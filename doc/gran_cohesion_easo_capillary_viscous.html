<PRE>cohesion easo/capillary/viscous 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This model can be used as part of <A HREF = "pair_gran.html">pair gran</A>
It adds a liquid bridge force, caused by a surface liquid film on the particles,
to a pair of particles, which consists
of a capilary and a viscous part. Furthermore, it solves for the
transfer of surface liquid from one particle to the other as the bridge breaks up.
The model uses a parameter, <I>maxSeparationDistanceRatio</I>, to apply a cut-off
to the liquid bridge force, i.e. <I>radius</I>*<I>maxSeparationDistanceRatio</I> is
the effective contact radius of the particles.
</P>
<HR>

<P>Bridge formation and break-up, surface liquid transfer:
</P>
<P><I>Vbond</I>, the volume of surface liquid involved in the bridge, is given by
</P>
<PRE>Vbond = 0.05*(surfaceLiquidVolI+surfaceLiquidVolJ) 
</PRE>
where <I>surfaceLiquidVolI/J</I> is the surface liquid volume attached to particle i/j.
This model assumes that bridge formation occurs upon contact and
the rupture distance is given as follows by <A HREF = "#Lian">(Lian)</A> 

<PRE>dist0 = (1+contactAngleEff/2)*Vbond^(1/3) 
</PRE>
<P>When the bridge breaks, it is assumed that the surface liquid volume
distributes evenly to the two particles.
</P>
<HR>

<P>Capilary force:
</P>
<P>The capilary force is given by <A HREF = "#Soulie">(Soulie)</A> as:
</P>
<PRE>Fcapilary = - pi*surfaceTension*sqrt(radi*radj)*(exp(A*dist/R2+B)+C) 
</PRE>
<P>where
</P>
<PRE>volBondScaled = volBond/R2^3
A = -1.1*volBondScaled^(-0.53)
B = (-0.148*log(volBondScaled)-0.96)*contactAngleEff*contactAngleEff - 0.0082*log(volBondScaled) + 0.48
C = 0.0018*log(volBondScaled)+0.078;
contactAngleEff = 0.5*(contactAngleI+contactAngleJ) 
</PRE>
<P><I>dist</I> is the distance between the particles' surfaces, <I>surfaceTension</I> is the surface tension
of the fluid, <I>contactAngleI/J</I> are the contact angles for particle i/j and the fluid. <I>R2</I> is the
radius of the larger of the two particles in contact.
</P>
<HR>

<P>Viscous force:
</P>
the normal and tangential parts of the viscous force are calculated as given by <A HREF = "#Nase">(Nase)</A> 

<PRE>rEff = radi*radj/(radi+radj)
stokesPreFactor = 6*pi*fluidViscosity*rEff
FviscN = stokesPreFactor*vn*rEff/dist
FviscT = stokesPreFactor*vt*(8/15*log(rEff/dist)+0.9588) 
</PRE>
<P>where <I>vn</I> and <I>vt</I> are the normal and tangential relative velocities of the
particles at the contact point, <I>fluidViscosity</I> is the viscosity of the fluid
and <I>ri</I> and <I>rj</I> are the particle radii. An additional parameter,
<I>minSeparationDistanceRatio</I>, is used to prevent the value of the viscous force from
becoming too large, i.e. <I>radius</I>*<I>minSeparationDistanceRatio</I> is assumed to be
the minimum separation distance.
</P>
<HR>

<P>Computation of liquid transport and effect of liquid content on other particle properties:
</P>
<P>Per default, this model automatically instatiates a scalar transport equation that solved for
the surface liquid content of each particles, expressed in volume % of solid volume
(4/3 pi * radius ^3). The surface liquid volume is assumed to be small, i.e. it is assumed
to have no effect on the particle mass, diameter and density.
</P>
<P>The user can override the default behavior by explicity specifing a fix that solves
for the surface liquid transport between particles. Such fixes are
<A HREF = "fix_liquidtransport_porous.html">fix liquidtransport/porous</A> or
<A HREF = "fix_liquidtransport_sponge.html">fix liquidtransport/sponge</A>
</P>
<HR>

<P>Intialization:
</P>
<PRE>If you are using the this model model, you must define the following properties:
fix id all property/global minSeparationDistanceRatio scalar value
    (value=value for the minimum separation distance, recommended as 1.01)
fix id all property/global maxSeparationDistanceRatio scalar value
    (value=value for the maximum separation distance, recommended as 1.1)
fix id all property/global surfaceLiquidContentInitial scalar value
    (value=value for the initial surface liquid volume in % of the solid volume)
fix id all property/global surfaceTension scalar value
    (value=value for the surface tension of liquid (SI units N/m))
fix id all property/global fluidViscosity scalar value
    (value=value for the fluidViscosity (SI units Pas))
fix id all property/global contactAngle peratomtype value_1 value_2 ...
    (value_i=value for contact angle of atom type i and fluid)

<P><B>Output:</B>
</P>
<P>This gran model stores a couple of per-particle properties, for access
by various <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#4_15">output commands</A>.
</P>
<P>You can access the property surfaceLiquidContent by f_surfaceLiquidContent[0]
(units % of solid particle volume), liquidFlux (units % of solid particle volume/time)
by accessing f_liquidFlux[0] and liquidSource (units % of solid particle volume/time)
by accessing f_liquidSource[0]. The latter can be used to manually set a
surface liquid source via the <A HREF = "set.html">set</A> command.
</P>
<P>Currently, there is a restriction that these properties can only be accessed
after a <A HREF = "run.html">run 0</A> command.
